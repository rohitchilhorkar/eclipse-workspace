How to run SpringBoot Project?
	- From the main file, like we do in react
	- SpringBootIntroApplication.java:  src/main/java/com.springboot>
	
Rest API:: Will send the Json file to client
-- SpringBoot doesn't have jsp file.
-- we return string directly not an jsp file.

--> JSP change to SpringBoot

--> @Controller change to @RestController

--> Instead of @RequestMapping("/") we will use HTTP protocol method
	@GetMapping, @PostMapping
	
--------------PNR Controller Code----------
After adding all the annotations, we have to give the input to that function,
	- It can be passed in url itself after appending ?parmeter_name=213
	- Output will be in JSON format.[By Default].
	- Input can be given through the URL, weatherapi also works in the same way
	"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={cityname}&appid={API key}"
	 - If we explicitly write @requestParam("name_to_pass"), then strictly, we must use this name
	 
@CrossOrigin must be added in order
